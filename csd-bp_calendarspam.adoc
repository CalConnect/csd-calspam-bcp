.Foreword
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium ("`CalConnect`") is global non-profit
organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications.

CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further
maintenance are described in the CalConnect Directives.

In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different types of
ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the
editorial rules of the CalConnect Directives.

== Introduction

"Calendar spam", unsolicited calendar events and meeting invitations, is a
recently exploited channel inserting unsolicited or otherwise unwanted events
and invitations into calendaring and scheduling systems. It is a new form of
application-specific spam which takes advantage of the application layer across
multiple technologies that spans scheduling, calendaring and messaging systems.
As is the case with email spam, calendar spam is not only used to deliver
unwanted information, but can also be used for malicious purposes such as
phishing attempts and delivering dangerous payloads.

This CalConnect Standard provides guidelines for calendar system operators to
better protect users from receiving undesired information delivered
through calendar systems.


:sectnums:
== Scope

This document specifies guidelines for calendaring system operators to:

* detect the occurrence of calendar abuse;

* processes and procedures to mitigate calendar abuse; and

* definition of acceptable practices with calendar usage.

NOTE: The term _calendar system_ in this standard specifically refers to calendaring systems that fulfill the requirements of CalConnect calendaring standards.

[[calendar-spam]]
=== calendar spam

unsolicited calendar events and meeting invitations delivered through calendaring systems

[[calendar-abuse]]
=== calendar abuse

malicious usage of a _calendar system_ (<<calendar-system>>), possibly leading to an _attack_ (<<ISO27000,ISO/IEC 27000 3.2>>) on the receiving user

== Calendar abuse flow

=== General

=== Defining calendar abuse

=== Creation of abusive content

=== Delivery of abusive content

=== Consequences of abusive content


== Process

There should be a "calendar abuse management process" in place.

Define policies, roles and responsibilities.

Document policies, procedures to ensure process is resilient.

=== Policies

Determine policy of acceptable calendar user behavior.


=== Acceptable calendar user behavior

==== Typical behavior

==== Defining acceptability


== Managing calendar abuse

=== General

Four stages:

* Detect
* Identify
* Block
* Report

== Identifying calendar abuse

=== General

=== Types of abuse

==== Spam

==== Malware


== Blocking calendar abuse

=== General

=== Preventing false positives


== Reporting calendar abuse

=== General

=== Reporting parties

=== Managing


== How management of calendar abuse interacts with other processes

* Information security management <<ISO27001>>
* IT service management (ISO/IEC 20000-1)
* Vulnerability management

This document defines four classes of requirements and conformance. <<AnnexA>>
specifies how conformance with these classes shall be tested.
